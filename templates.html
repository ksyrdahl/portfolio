                <h3>What is the California Lighting and Technology Center?</h3>
                <p>
                    The California Lighting and Technology Center (CLTC) is a research and development facility connected to the University of California Davis. CLTC conducts research on the effects of artificial light and uses that research to develop solutions to improve lighting technology. As a result, they are constantly publishing research papers and informing the public on the newest, best lighting practices. To inform the public of new announcements connected to the facility, they have a newsletter to which the public can subscribe and they also are consistently presenting their work through PowerPoint presentations.</p>
                <p>
                    CLTC recently redesigned the visual composition of their website to be more modern and asked me to help redesign their Newsletter and PowerPoint presentation template to align with their new website visual composition.</p>

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>
                            To make sure the visual design of the Newsletter and PowerPoint were consistent with the visual design of the website, I collected research on the design patterns in the CLTC website. Since CLTC is connected to UC Davis, I pulled from the Brand Standard of the school while also trying to incorporate elements that differentiated the two organizations.</p>

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>

            <article id="visual">

                        <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
                        <div class="blueline"></div>
                        <p>
                            I took the color scheme from the UC Davis brand standard color guide which consists of shades of blue and yellow. I used shades of the blue for body and title text and yellow for accents and buttons.</p>

                        <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
                        <div class="blueline"></div>
                        <p>
                            I noticed on the UC Davis websites there is a recurring theme of a line of yellow circles to seperate sections of information and draw attention to specific titles, so I incorporated that into the design of the Newsletter Template.</p>

                        <div class="blueline"></div>
                        <p>
                            Another pattern that I noticed was angled blocks of color. Since the PowerPoint template needed simple visuals, I incorporated this into slide headers of the PowerPoint template.</p>
                    </section>
                    <img src="images/angled.png" alt="Angled blocks of color">

                        <p>
                            For the newsletter I needed to stay within the UC Davis brand standard but also find a way to make the design unique to CLTC. I noticed the UC Davis website had a large monochromatic drawing of iconic UC Davis symbols to separate the footer from the top content. I decided to create something similar for the Newsletter, but incorporate small Easter eggs of symbols that represent Lighting or CLTC.</p>

                        <div class="blueline"></div>
                        <p>
                            My immediate impression of the original design was that it was not strongly impactful. If the receiver did not pay attention to the email subject, it was not obvious what organization this newsletter was from or what it was about. There was no logo or title.</p>
                        <p>
                            People have short attentions spans and if you do not capture their attention right away, they will most likely click out of the newsletter without reading anything.</p>

                        <p>For my redesign I included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A logo at the top so users immediately know who sent them the email.</li>
                            <li>A short catchy title to entice readers to read more.</li>
                            <li>A more descriptive title under the image that gives more context to the image.</li>
                            <li>Small graphical elements from the UC Davis branding, such as small yellow circles to highlight certain titles and a blue watercolor graphic to add more depth to the design.</li>
                            <li>A yellow “Explore More!” button, instead of blue, to make it stand out more and attract users to click the link.</li>

                        <p>
                            The biggest addition to my redesign was the graphic in the footer. It is an adaptation of a graphic from the UC Davis branding to which I added a large LED Light Bulb and multiple lamp posts to represent their research and development in artificial lighting. I also added a building with large windows to represent their research in natural lighting.</p>

                        <div class="blueline"></div>
                        <p>
                            For the Newsletter, CLTC wanted two versions. They wanted one design where they could just make one quick announcement and another where they could summarize multiple important announcements that have happened throughout the year.</p>
                        <p>
                            I kept a similar layout for both, the only difference being that for the design with multiple articles, I had one main announcement at the top of the design and then a grid of additional announcements that users could browse through and click on.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="searchvideo">

            <h2>Presentation</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    For the presentation, the design needed to be interesting but since CLTC conducts a wide range of research it also needed to be simple enough that it could be versatile.</p>
                <p>
                    The design had three main parts: a title slide, a section title slide, and a content slide.</p>
                <section id="slides">

                <section>
                    <p>
                        For the visual design I focused on uniting the presentation visually through a hard edged gradient of UC Davis blue and consistent placement of the CLTC logo in the bottom left corner. The location and angle of the gradient changes to differentiate the slides but every slide has a gradient.</p>
                    <p>
                        The hard edged gradient is angled as a reference to the design pattern of geometric shapes that I observed throughout the UC Davis and CLTC website design. These angled shapes are horizontal to allow for more room for a long title.</p>
                    <p>
                        For the Section Title Slide there are two options. One option has horizontal angled geometric shapes like the Title Slide and the other has vertical shapes. These are designed for either long or short section titles.</p>

                        <p>
                            Each title slide includes a stock image for people who don’t want to search for their own. In the template, I offered multiple stock photo options to choose from for different types of content.</p>
                        <p>
                            However, I also designed the photo placement so it would be easy to replace the stock images with an image of their own selection. I wanted the template to be as easy to use as possible, so I added an instructions slide on how to replace the stock image in case they did not already know how to do this.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot from these two projects. I had to approach their designs in a different method than I would normally approach a design. Normally when I start a project, I have the content that is going to be used in the design and I think about the most efficient and visually appealing way to design the content to achieve the the goal of the project.</p>
                <p>
                    However, since this project was a template, I didn’t have content to arrange but instead had to think of all the different types of content that might be used in these templates. This forced me to think about the future and it’s multiple possibilities. This is a valuable skill that I can incorporate into future projects even when they are not templates.</p>
