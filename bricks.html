                    <p  class="summary">
                        The Brick Project stems from a larger art installation called the Davis Centennial Seal. It is placed in the center of downtown Davis. Around this seal are commemorative bricks. Some of these bricks where donated while others represent important people and families in the history of Davis. The seal is a large round metal seal designed by the local artist Susan Shelton. This historic seal can be found near the popular Davis native coffee shop Mishkas.</p>
                    <p class="summary">

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        Davis had this beautiful piece of art that so many people in the community dontated towards to help create and then became part of the art instillation through their own engraved brick. However, the problem was that there were so many bricks that these donors were unable to locate their engraved brick.</p>
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        The proposed solution for this issue was to create a responsive platform with an interactive map of the donated bricks surrounding the seal allowing donors to find the bricks that they donated. The primary goal of the project was to solve the original problem by allowing users to search for a name and be shown where that brick is located. However, then I came up with a secondary goal which was to provide an interactive map where users can click on certain bricks and see who else in the community has contributed to the bricks.</p>

                        <p>
                            My target audience is long-time Davis residents 40 to 70 years of age. They will have lived in Davis long enough to have decided to donate money to the construction of the monument and be given a brick. They still live in Davis and frequently pass by the Centennial Seal to go to Mishkas.</p>

                        <p>
                            I conducted interviews of people from my target audience. In these interviews, I asked about their confidence with using technology and they indicated that they were fairly confident which was surprising to me because they are from an older audience. However, they did say they prefer to not use technology most of the time. This made me realize how important it is that I make the website simple and quick to use.</p>
                        <p>
                            If I create something that is too complicated or has too many options they are more likely to give up on the website than someone who uses technology often and might prefer more options. I originally had planned to add extra information about each brick to the website, but decided to simplify it to only display what is written on the brick so my target audience would be more likely to use the website.</p>

                            During my target audience interviews, I also learned that one thing the brick donors have in common is their love for Davis. As a result, I tried to reflect Davis in my color choices. I picked colors that were consistent with the City of Davis website, blue, green, and golden yellow. </p>

                            My map design went through multiple iterations. I originally displayed all of the individual bricks in the map when the webpage was first opened. However, I received feedback that this was overwhelming. My question was how to allow users to access all of the bricks but make that information more palatable.</p>

                            I decided to do more research on designs such as concert seating, like Ticketmaster, which also deal with lots of individual interactive elements. I discovered that what these sites typically do is chunk the information into sections for users to click on. I took that idea and created blocked out sections for the bricks and when the user clicks on one of the sections, then the individual bricks appear. I found this helped decrease some of the cognitive overload.</p>

                            I added a search bar to the bottom of the page to make user interactions easier. There is a data base of names on the bricks that users can search through by either typing into the search bar or scrolling through the names, which are listed alphabetically. This feature is mostly for people who know what name is on the brick they are searching for but want to know where it is located.</p>

                            If users click on one of the 8 lettered sections, the graphic will zoom in and show the individual bricks in that section. Each individual brick is interactive and if a user taps on the brick it will trigger a pop up which shows what is written on that brick. This feature is for users who want to find and learn more about a physical brick they are looking at the site of the Centennial Seal.</p>

                            Once users search or click on a brick, that brick is outlined in yellow. This is so they know which brick has been selected in the digital space and use it to correlate to the brick in the physical space. In order to find their brick it was important for them to be able to zoom in and out to see the whole map as well as move the map around in the frame.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a big challenge for me and I knew it would be, but I wanted to challenge myself. I think my forte in website design is my addition of illustrations, so I picked this project specifically because I knew it would not be illustration heavy and would instead force me to focus more heavily on JavaScript and User Interactions.</p>
                <p>
                    I learned so much about JavaScript and how to use JSON files with this project. I pushed myself to use JSON to populate the search bar and other parts of the HTML and I actually got it to work. Even though everything is not as polished as it could be, I am still extremely proud of everything I accomplished in this project especially with the JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    This project was meant to be a stepping stone for someone else to build on, as a result it is still a work in progress. I created the visual design, the skeleton for the code, and only two rows of the bricks are currently functional. Another student asked to continue the project after I graduated and is currently using the notes from my code to take on the second half of the project which is to finish imputing all of the data for the bricks. I am looking forward to seeing how the next person alters my code and visual design to make it even better.</p>
